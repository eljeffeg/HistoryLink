= HistoryLink =
HistoryLink will compare your direct ancestors (and their siblings) to projects on Geni that focus on Historical or Famous individuals. It will list any matches found, the relation, and what projects they belong to. Note that not being connected to the "[http://www.geni.com/worldfamilytree world family tree]" will severely limit the potential for ancestor matches.
